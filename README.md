# RSE-Interview-Task

Ontology Lookup Service.

Running the Program:
1. Save the script as RSE.py.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing RSE.py.
3. Run the program using the python command: python RSE.py

Usage:
1. The program will prompt you to enter the ID of the ontology you want to look up.
2. Enter a valid ontology ID (e.g., "agro") or Enter "q" to quit the program.
3. Once you enter an ID, you will be asked to choose the output format (Human Readable or Machine Readable).
4. The program will then output the result based on your choices.
5. This process keeps looping until you exit the program.
